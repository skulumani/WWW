                            He now spends his days cycling, attending to his cats, and espousing the virtues of <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> to whoever can bear to listen.

                            In his free time he enjoys looking at ways to apply geometric mechanics and control to spacecraft operations around asteroids.
